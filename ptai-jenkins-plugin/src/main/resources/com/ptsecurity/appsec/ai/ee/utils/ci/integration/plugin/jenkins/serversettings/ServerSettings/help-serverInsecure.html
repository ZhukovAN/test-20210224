This option explicitly allows plugin to perform "insecure" SSL connections with PT AI server. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle from JRE truststore or from explicitly defined certificate chain PEM file. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless this option is used.
